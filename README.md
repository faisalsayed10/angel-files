_Quick and Secure cloud storage for Angels!_

## Inspiration

Cloud Storage can be expensive. This inspired me to make my own cloud storage service.

## What it does

Angelfiles allows you to create folders and upload files which are kept highly secured in our database. I also implemented a highly reliable user authentication system which makes sure that your data is not stolen or leaked.

## How we built it

I built it using 3 major technologies and a ton of small other technologies. I used React and Chakra UI for building the front-end of this project and I used Firebase for authentication and database! This project was built in just 18 hours!

## Challenges we ran into

Honestly, this was not at all a simple project, I had to solve numerous bugs while building it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm happy that this project is actually fully complete with some complex functionalities such as authentication, file upload and security. Overall, I'm too proud of this project!

## What we learned

Angelhacks was fun and I learned to manage my time very well (The entire project was built in 18 hours!) + I got to work with some awesome technologies!

## What's next for Angelfiles

Currently, there are some limitations on the file size that we're uploading. My next goal is to remove all such limitations and also add more features in it.

## How to contribute?

- First clone the repository
- Setup a firebase project on your account (enable email-password authentication, cloud firestore, cloud storage)
- Copy the firebase config and put it in your own .env file in a similar manner as shown below

```
// .env.example
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaASxoxoxoxoxoxo
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=hahahaha.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=hahahaha
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=hahahaha.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=694569420
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456666:web:adwadafea
```

That's how you setup this project locally! Happy Hacking!
